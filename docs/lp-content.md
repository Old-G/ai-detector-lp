Frequently Asked Questions
**Section Subtitle:**
Everything you need to know about AI content detection

### Question 1

**Q:** How accurate is the AI detection?
**A:** Our AI detector maintains a 98% accuracy rate for Pro users and 95% for Free users. We
continuously train our models on the latest AI-generated content from GPT-4, Claude, Gemini,
and other leading AI systems. The detector analyzes over 50 linguistic parameters including
sentence structure, word choice patterns, and stylistic consistency.

### Question 2

**Q:** Which AI writing tools can you detect?
**A:** We can detect content generated by ChatGPT (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo), Claude
(all versions), Google Gemini, Jasper, Copy.ai, and most other AI writing assistants. Our
detection models are updated weekly to identify new AI tools and writing patterns.

### Question 3

**Q:** Is my content stored or used for training?
**A:** Absolutely not. We prioritize your privacy. All submitted content is analyzed in real-time
and immediately deleted from our servers after processing. We never store your text, use it for
model training, or share it with third parties. Our service is fully GDPR compliant.

### Question 4

**Q:** Can I use this for academic purposes?
**A:** Yes! Our AI detector is widely used by educators, universities, and students to verify
content authenticity. We provide detailed PDF reports suitable for academic documentation.
However, we recommend using our tool as part of a comprehensive assessment approach, not
as the sole determinant.

### Question 5

**Q:** What if I disagree with the detection results?
**A:** Our system provides probability scores rather than absolute judgments. If you believe
results are inaccurate, you can submit the content for manual review (Pro plan only). We also
show which specific sections triggered detection, allowing you to understand and verify our
analysis.
